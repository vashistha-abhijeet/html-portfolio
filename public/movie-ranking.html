    The story follows Nick Fury, the director of S.H.I.E.L.D., as he assembles a team of extraordinary heroes to stop an
    impending global threat. When Loki, the adopted brother of Thor, steals the Tesseract (a powerful energy source) and
    plans to use it with an alien army to conquer Earth, Fury recruits Earth’s mightiest heroes:

    that they truly are Earth’s Mightiest Heroes.
    <br /> The movie mixes action, humor, teamwork, and epic battles, and it set the stage for many MCU films that
    followed.
